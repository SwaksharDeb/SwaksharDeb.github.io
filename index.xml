Node Classification: A Novel Approach with
Local Lifting Scheme&amp;quot;&lt;/strong>. In this thesis work we focused to the phenomenon of production of undesirable wavelet filters within graph wavelet based neural networks and presented a solution framework to overcome this phenemonenon with with our proposed Tree Lifting Scheme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary.&lt;/strong> Wavelet-based graph neural networks have received increasing attention in various graph machine learning tasks. However, in node classification, existing graph wavelet-based methods are limited in their ability to generalize to arbitrary graphs due to their implementation of predefined wavelet filters with inherent homophilic assumptions while ignoring heterophily. Recent studies have attempted to address this issue through a wavelet lifting transform that requires the bipartite graph, therefore, altering the graph topology, and leading to undesirable wavelet filters. In this thesis, we introduce a novel class of graph wavelet neural network based on our proposed tree-lifting scheme that is able to learn adaptive wavelet filters over arbitrary graphs. Our proposed generalized adaptive graph wavelet network (GA-GWNN) preserves the graph topology through computation trees while implementing the lifting scheme on arbitrary graph structures. Additionally, we concentrate on the local substructure as an acyclic tree while implementing the lifting strategy locally. Moreover, this locally defined lifting scheme incorporates and fuses both high-pass and low-pass frequency components to enhance the feature representation. We further benchmark our proposed GA-GWNN model with three homophilic datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed), and four heterophilic datasets (Film, Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin) and to demonstrate the scalability of our proposed GA-GWNN we evaluated our model on two large-scale datasets namely, Ogbn-Arxiv and Ogbn-Products. In addition, we further introduce a more scaleable and computationally efficient version of GA-GWNN, namely simple and efficient adaptive graph wavelet neural network (SEA-GWNN).
SEA-GWNN incorporates higher-order neighborhoods to extract multiscale information and implements the lifting scheme without the need for an inverse transform. Additionally, SEA-GWNN introduces an attention detachment strategy, enabling the computation of attention parameters only once and re-utilizing them in successive layers, thus making SEA-GWNN more scalable compared to GA-GWNN. Finally, we benchmark this proposed SEA-GWNN on nine real-world homophilic and heterophilic datasets from three categories (i.e., citation, webpage, and film industry graphs) and four large-scale graphs, including Ogbn-Arxiv, Arxiv, Genius, and Penn94. The experimental results from these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Future Direction.&lt;/strong> This work presents Generalized Adaptive Wavelet Network that extends the vanilla lifting scheme on any arbitrary graph thus producing an adaptive graph wavelet based on the signal residing on the graph. &lt;em>(1)&lt;/em> Extending the work on this topic is an attempt to further reduce the computation cost associated with tree lifting structures. This approach will result in a more fine-grained rehab system. &lt;em>(2)&lt;/em> One can generalize the proposed framework into many other sectors. For example, the novelty of our framework also can be extended to human activity recognition, augmented reality, gaming, driving, etc. where designing wavelet filters based on the task at hand is crucial. &lt;em>(3)&lt;/em> Taking one step further, one can extend this proposed fusion model with a learnable aggregation function, where instead of aggregating with a fixed set of edge weights (fixed normalized adjacency matrix), one can learn these edge weights with an attention-based network. But one needs to be careful about the over-parametrization of the entire framework. &lt;em>(4)&lt;/em> From the theoretical viewpoint, one can further study the effect of over-smoothing on our proposed network. This may result in further analysis of the effect of our two-channel filter bank that was learned through successive lifting structures. This can be observed with the help of the node profile, that analysis the node behavior at each layer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A vector $\mathbf{X}$ is a direactional derivative acting on $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$ as $\mathbf{X}: f \to \mathbf{X}[f]$. However, there is no direactional derivative acting on a tensor field of type $(p,q)$, which arises naturally from the differential structure $M$. What we need is an extra structure called the connection, which specify how tensors are transported along a curve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="covariant-derivative">Covariant Derivative&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We first give a heuristic approach to parallel transport and covariant derivatives. As we know that, two vectors defined at different points can not be compared naively with each other even though there may exist isomorphism between two vector spaces that share the same chart $(U,\phi)$ (e.g., chart induced basis). This arises from the phenomenon of connection and parallel transport that will introduce in the subsequent sections. Keeping this in mind, let us see how the derivative of a vector field in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$ is defined, where $m$ is the dimension o fthe manifold. The derivative of a vector field $V = v^u e_u$, where $e_u = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u}$, with respect to $x^v$ has the $u$-th component.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\frac{\partial v^u}{\partial x^v} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{V^u(\ldots,x^v+\Delta x^v,\ldots)}{\Delta x^v}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, $V^u(\ldots, x^v+\Delta x^v, \ldots)$ is the $u$-th component of the vector field $V$ at point $(\ldots, x^v+\Delta x^v, \ldots)$ and $V^u(\ldots, x^v, \ldots)$ is the $u$-th component of that vector field, $V$, at point $x$. To substract $V^u(x)$ from $V^u(x+\Delta x)$, we have to transport $V^u(x)$ to the point $x+\Delta x$ without change and compute the difference. This transport of a vector is called a &lt;em>Parallel Transport&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition&lt;/strong>: Parallel transport maps a vector $X$ at point $p$ that lives on a vector space $T_{p}M$ to a vector $Y$ at point $q$ that lives on a vector space $T_{q}M$, mathematically represented as $X \in T_{p}M \to Y \in T_{q}M$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intituively, this definition of the parallel transport represents the corresponding vector of $X \in T_pM$ in the vector space $T_qM$. Bascially it is a way of moving a vector over the manifold $M$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While defining this parallel transport, we have implicitly assumed that $V\vert_x$ parallel transported to $x+\Delta x$ has the same component $V^{u}(x)$. However, there is no natural way to parallel transport a vector in a manifold and we have to specify &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;how it is parallel transported&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> from one point to other. Let $\tilde{V}\vert_{x+\Delta x}$ denote a vector $V\vert_x$ parallel transported to $x+\Delta x$. We demand that the components satisfy:
$$\tilde{V}^{u}(x+\Delta x) - V^u(x) \propto \Delta x$$
$$\widetilde{(V^u + W^u)}(x+\Delta x) = \tilde{V}(x+\Delta x) + \tilde{W}^u(x+\Delta x)$$&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- $$\tilde{V}^{u}(x+\Delta x) - V^u(x) &amp;\propto \Delta x $$ -->
&lt;!-- \widetilde{(V^u + W^u)}(x+\Delta x) &amp;= \tilde{V}(x+\Delta x) + \tilde{W}^u(x+\Delta x) \nonumber -->
&lt;p>These condition are satisfy if we take:
$$
\tilde{V}^u(x+\Delta x) = V^{u}(x) \Gamma_{v\lambda}^u (x) \Delta x^v
$$
The covariant derivative of a vector with respect to $x^v$ is defined by:
$$
\lim_{\Delta x^v \to 0} \frac{V^{u}(x+\Delta x)-\tilde{V}^u(x+\Delta x)}{\Delta x^v} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$=\lim_{\Delta x^v \to 0} \frac{V^{u}(x+\Delta x)-V^u(x)-V^{\lambda}(x)\Gamma^{u}_{v\lambda}\Delta x^v}{\Delta x^v} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$=(\frac{\partial V^u}{\partial x^v} + V^{\lambda}\Gamma_{v\lambda}^u) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$= (\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^v}} V)^u $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, $(\nabla_{e_v} V)^u$ represents the $u$-th component of the covariant derivative along the $e_v$ direaction at point $x+\Delta x$ and the $\nabla$ denotes &lt;em>connection&lt;/em>, which will be covered in the subsequent section. The quantity in Eqn $(2)$ is a vector at $x+\Delta x$ since, it is a difference of two vectors $V\vert_{x+\Delta x}$ and $\tilde{V}\vert_{x+\Delta x}$ defined at the same point $x+\Delta x$. There are many distinct rules of parallel transport possible, one for each choice of $\Gamma$. If the manifold is endowed with the metric, there exist a predefined choice of $\Gamma$, called Levi Civita Connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="affine-connection">Affine Connection&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> An affine connection $\nabla$ is a map: $\chi (M) \times \chi(M) \to \chi(M)$, or $(X,Y) \to \nabla_{X}Y$ which satisfy the following conditions:
$$\nabla_{X}(Y+Z) = \nabla_{X}Y + \nabla_{X}Z$$
$$\nabla_{X+Y}(Z) = \nabla_{X}Z + \nabla_{Y}Z$$
$$\nabla_{fX}(Y) = f \nabla_{X}Y $$
$$\nabla_{X}(fY) = X[f]Y + f\nabla_{X}Y $$
where, $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$, $\chi(M)$ denotes vector field and $X,Y,Z \in \chi(M)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a chart $(U,\phi)$ with the condition $x=\phi(p)$ on $M$, and define $\Gamma_{uv}^\lambda$ called the connection coefficients by:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\nabla_v e_u = \nabla_{e_v} e_u = \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^v}} = e_{\lambda} \Gamma_{uv}^\lambda$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where, ${e_u} = {\frac{\partial}{\partial x^u}}$ is the cordinate basis in $T_{p}M$. The connection coefficient specify how the basis vectors change from point to point. Let $V=V^ue_u$ and $W = W^ue_v$ be elements of $T_pM$. Then, $\nabla_V W$ is the connection of the vector $W$, at the direaction of the vector $V$. Intuitively, $\nabla_V W$ tells, if we move the vector at $T_pM$ at direction indicated by the vector $V \in T_pM$, what is the difference between vector components and how the basis vector changes. Mathematially,
$$
\nabla_V W = \nabla_{V^u e_u} W^v e_v = V^u \nabla_{e_u} W^v + V^u W^v \nabla_{e_u} e_v
$$
$$
= V^u (\frac{\partial W^\lambda}{\partial x^u}+W^v \Gamma_{uv}^\lambda) e_{\lambda}
$$
Thus the $\lambda$-th component of $\nabla_V W$ is defined as:
$$(\nabla_V W)^\lambda = V^u (\frac{\partial W^\lambda}{\partial x^u} + W^v \Gamma_{uv}^{\lambda})$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that this definition of the connection coefficient is in agreement with the previous heuristic result. By definition, $\nabla$ maps two vectors $V$ and $W$ to a new vector.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="parallel-transport-and-geodesics">Parallel Transport and Geodesics&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Given a curve in a manifold $M$, we may define the parallel transport of a vector along the curve. Let $c:(a,b) \to M$ be a curve in $M$. For simplicity, we assume a small image is covered by a chart $(U,\phi)$, whoose coordinate is $x=\phi(p)$. Let $X$ be a vector field defined along $c(t)$: $X\vert_{c(t)} = X^u(c(t)) e_u\vert_{c(t)}$, where $e_u = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u}$. If $X$ satisfies the conidtion: $\nabla_V X = 0$ for any $t \in (a,b)$. $X$ is said to be parallel transported along $c(t)$ and from the chain rule we know, $\frac{d}{dt} = \frac{dx^u(c(t))}{dt} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u}$, where, $x^u(c(t)) = x^u \circ c$. Thus $V = \frac{d}{dt} = \frac{dx^u(c(t))}{dt} e_u\vert_{c(t)}$ is the tangent vector to $c(t)$. The condition is written as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\nabla_V X = 0 $$
$$V^u \frac{\partial X^u}{\partial x^u} + \Gamma_{uv}^\lambda V^{u} X^{v} = 0 $$
$$\frac{dx^u(c(t))}{dt} \frac{\partial X^{\lambda}}{\partial x^u} + \Gamma_{uv}^{\lambda} V^{u} X^v = 0 $$
$$\frac{dX^\lambda}{dt} + \Gamma^{\lambda}_{uv} \frac{dx^u(c(t))}{dt} X^v = 0 $$
If the tangent vector $v(t)$ itself is parallel transported along $c(t)$, namely if
$$\nabla_V V = 0$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the curve $c(t)$ is called geodesic. Geodesic are, in a sense, the straighest possible curves in a Reimenian manifold. In components, the geodesic equation becomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{d^2x^u}{dt^2} + \Gamma^u_{v\lambda} \frac{dx^v}{dt} \frac{dx^{\lambda}}{dt} = 0
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- $$\frac{dX^{\lambda}}{dt} + \Gamma^{\lambda}_{uv} V^u X^v = 0 $$ --></description></item><item><title>Our project "IHABOT" accepted for the prestigious Centennial Research Grant</title><link>https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2023-ihabot_news.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2023-ihabot_news.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Very fortunate to be a part of the IHABOT project, where I was in a team that designed an interactive human-computer interface that collects the RGBD data of the rehabilitation patients with Microsoft Kinectv2 and provide real-time exercise correctness score.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Actions, not gestures: contextualising embodied controller interactions in immersive virtual reality</title><link>https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Not Very Effective: Validity Issues of the Effectance in Games Scale</title><link>https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Our paper "Graph Convolutional Networks for Assessment of Physical Rehabilitation Exercises" is presented in CVPR'22, WiCV Workshop</title><link>https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2022-cvpr_wicv.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2022-cvpr_wicv.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Our paper titled &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Graph Convolutional Networks for Assessment of Physical Rehabilitation Exercises&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>, is presented in the &lt;em>CVPR'22&lt;/em>, &lt;em>WiCV Workshop&lt;/em>, New Orleans, Louisiana.
