The title of my M.Sc. thesis was \u0026#34; Empowering Graph Wavelet Convolution for Node Classification: A Novel Approach with Local Lifting Scheme\u0026#34;. In this thesis work we focused to the phenomenon of production of undesirable wavelet filters within graph wavelet based neural networks and presented a solution framework to overcome this phenemonenon with with our proposed Tree Lifting Scheme.\nSummary. Wavelet-based graph neural networks have received increasing attention in various graph machine learning tasks. However, in node classification, existing graph wavelet-based methods are limited in their ability to generalize to arbitrary graphs due to their implementation of predefined wavelet filters with inherent homophilic assumptions while ignoring heterophily. Recent studies have attempted to address this issue through a wavelet lifting transform that requires the bipartite graph, therefore, altering the graph topology, and leading to undesirable wavelet filters. In this thesis, we introduce a novel class of graph wavelet neural network based on our proposed tree-lifting scheme that is able to learn adaptive wavelet filters over arbitrary graphs. Our proposed generalized adaptive graph wavelet network (GA-GWNN) preserves the graph topology through computation trees while implementing the lifting scheme on arbitrary graph structures. Additionally, we concentrate on the local substructure as an acyclic tree while implementing the lifting strategy locally. Moreover, this locally defined lifting scheme incorporates and fuses both high-pass and low-pass frequency components to enhance the feature representation. We further benchmark our proposed GA-GWNN model with three homophilic datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed), and four heterophilic datasets (Film, Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin) and to demonstrate the scalability of our proposed GA-GWNN we evaluated our model on two large-scale datasets namely, Ogbn-Arxiv and Ogbn-Products. In addition, we further introduce a more scaleable and computationally efficient version of GA-GWNN, namely simple and efficient adaptive graph wavelet neural network (SEA-GWNN). SEA-GWNN incorporates higher-order neighborhoods to extract multiscale information and implements the lifting scheme without the need for an inverse transform. Additionally, SEA-GWNN introduces an attention detachment strategy, enabling the computation of attention parameters only once and re-utilizing them in successive layers, thus making SEA-GWNN more scalable compared to GA-GWNN. Finally, we benchmark this proposed SEA-GWNN on nine real-world homophilic and heterophilic datasets from three categories (i.e., citation, webpage, and film industry graphs) and four large-scale graphs, including Ogbn-Arxiv, Arxiv, Genius, and Penn94. The experimental results from these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nFuture Direction. This work presents Generalized Adaptive Wavelet Network that extends the vanilla lifting scheme on any arbitrary graph thus producing an adaptive graph wavelet based on the signal residing on the graph. (1) Extending the work on this topic is an attempt to further reduce the computation cost associated with tree lifting structures. This approach will result in a more fine-grained rehab system. (2) One can generalize the proposed framework into many other sectors. For example, the novelty of our framework also can be extended to human activity recognition, augmented reality, gaming, driving, etc. where designing wavelet filters based on the task at hand is crucial. (3) Taking one step further, one can extend this proposed fusion model with a learnable aggregation function, where instead of aggregating with a fixed set of edge weights (fixed normalized adjacency matrix), one can learn these edge weights with an attention-based network. But one needs to be careful about the over-parametrization of the entire framework. (4) From the theoretical viewpoint, one can further study the effect of over-smoothing on our proposed network. This may result in further analysis of the effect of our two-channel filter bank that was learned through successive lifting structures. This can be observed with the help of the node profile, that analysis the node behavior at each layer.\nMore information:\nM.Sc thesis defence presentation slides with animations ","date":1688947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688947200,"objectID":"bcbcff3cc776cd413546f797aaac134f","permalink":"https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2023-phd-offer.html","publishdate":"2023-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-phd-offer.html","section":"news","summary":"Empowering Graph Wavelet Convolution for Node Classification-- A Novel Approach with Local Lifting Scheme","tags":["Personal"],"title":"I have successfully defended my M.Sc.

Traditionally, patients are supported by skilled therapists who monitor their progress and evaluate the program’s effectiveness. Due to a shortage of qualified therapists, rehabilitation facilities are both expensive and inadequate. Furthermore, evaluations may be subjective and prone to errors. These limitations motivate the researchers to devise automated systems with minimal human intervention, therapist-like assessment, and broader outreach. This article reviews seminal works from 2013 onwards, qualitatively and quantitatively adapting the PRISMA approach to examine the potential of robot-assisted, virtual reality-based rehabilitation and automated assessments through data-driven learning. Extensive experimentation on KIMORE and UIPRMD datasets reveal high agreement between automated methods and therapists. Our investigation shows that deep learning with spatio-temporal skeleton data and dynamic attention outperforms others, with an RMSE as low as 0.55.

One example is examining typical perceptions of a product based on customer feedbacks to have a better understanding of consumer expectations, which can help enhance everything from customer service to product offerings. Online review comments, on the other hand, frequently mix different languages, use non-native scripts and do not adhere to strict grammar norms. For a low-resource language like Bangla, the lack of annotated code-mixed data makes automated sentiment analysis more challenging. To address this, we collect online reviews of different products and construct an annotated Bangla-English code mix (BE-CM) dataset (Dataset and other resources are available at https://github.com/fokhruli/CM-seti-anlysis ). On our sentiment corpus, we also compare several alternative models from the existing literature. We present a simple but effective data augmentation method that can be utilized with existing word embedding algorithms without the need for a parallel corpus to improve cross-lingual contextual understanding. Our experimental results suggest that training word embedding models (e.g., Word2vec, FastText) with our data augmentation strategy can help the model in capturing the cross-lingual relationship for code-mixed sentences, thereby improving the overall performance of existing classifiers in both supervised learning and zero-shot cross-lingual adaptability. With extensive experimentations, we found that XGBoost with Fasttext embedding trained on our proposed data augmentation method outperforms other alternative models in automated sentiment analysis on code-mixed Bangla-English dataset, with a weighted F1 score of 87%.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Sentiment Analysis"],"title":"Data-augmentation for Bangla-English Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis: Enhancing Cross Linguistic Contextual Understanding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tahsin Tariq Banna","**Swakshar Deb**","Sejuti Rahman","Shafin Rahman"],"categories":null,"content":" Figure: The GEMM Architecture.

The object-centric features within the images are extracted using deep CNN-based models, which contain the structural information of the image. A generic baseline model is created and improved upon iteratively through structural data by constructing graphs and attention mechanisms on the graph edge connections.

These graph embeddings are used to train our proposed Graph Embedded Memorability Model (GEMM), which shows significant improvements from the baseline as the attention improves the edge connections of the graph nodes.

When patients perform those exercises in the absence of an expert (e.g., physicians/therapists), they cannot assess the correctness of the performance. Automatic assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises aims to assign a quality score given an RGBD video of the body movement as input. Recent deep learning approaches address this problem by extracting CNN features from co-ordinate grids of skeleton data (body-joints) obtained from videos. However, they could not extract rich spatio-temporal features from variable-length inputs. To address this issue, we investigate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for this task. We adapt spatio-temporal GCN to predict continuous scores(assessment) instead of discrete class labels. Our model can process variable-length inputs so that users can perform any number of repetitions of the prescribed exercise. Moreover, our novel design also provides self-attention of body-joints, indicating their role in predicting assessment scores. It guides the user to achieve a better score in future trials by matching the same attention weights of expert users. Our model successfully outperforms existing exercise assessment methods on KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets.","tags":["Graph Convolution","Rehabilitation Exercises"],"title":"Graph Convolutional Networks for Assessment of Physical Rehabilitation Exercises","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Introduction A vector $\\mathbf{X}$ is a direactional derivative acting on $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$ as $\\mathbf{X}: f \\to \\mathbf{X}[f]$. However, there is no direactional derivative acting on a tensor field of type $(p,q)$, which arises naturally from the differential structure $M$. What we need is an extra structure called the connection, which specify how tensors are transported along a curve.\nCovariant Derivative We first give a heuristic approach to parallel transport and covariant derivatives. As we know that, two vectors defined at different points can not be compared naively with each other even though there may exist isomorphism between two vector spaces that share the same chart $(U,\\phi)$ (e.g., chart induced basis). This arises from the phenomenon of connection and parallel transport that will introduce in the subsequent sections. Keeping this in mind, let us see how the derivative of a vector field in a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is defined, where $m$ is the dimension o fthe manifold. The derivative of a vector field $V = v^u e_u$, where $e_u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^u}$, with respect to $x^v$ has the $u$-th component.\n$$\\frac{\\partial v^u}{\\partial x^v} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{V^u(\\ldots,x^v+\\Delta x^v,\\ldots)}{\\Delta x^v}$$\nHere, $V^u(\\ldots, x^v+\\Delta x^v, \\ldots)$ is the $u$-th component of the vector field $V$ at point $(\\ldots, x^v+\\Delta x^v, \\ldots)$ and $V^u(\\ldots, x^v, \\ldots)$ is the $u$-th component of that vector field, $V$, at point $x$. To substract $V^u(x)$ from $V^u(x+\\Delta x)$, we have to transport $V^u(x)$ to the point $x+\\Delta x$ without change and compute the difference. This transport of a vector is called a Parallel Transport.\nDefinition: Parallel transport maps a vector $X$ at point $p$ that lives on a vector space $T_{p}M$ to a vector $Y$ at point $q$ that lives on a vector space $T_{q}M$, mathematically represented as $X \\in T_{p}M \\to Y \\in T_{q}M$.\nIntituively, this definition of the parallel transport represents the corresponding vector of $X \\in T_pM$ in the vector space $T_qM$. Bascially it is a way of moving a vector over the manifold $M$.\nWhile defining this parallel transport, we have implicitly assumed that $V\\vert_x$ parallel transported to $x+\\Delta x$ has the same component $V^{u}(x)$. However, there is no natural way to parallel transport a vector in a manifold and we have to specify “how it is parallel transported” from one point to other. Let $\\tilde{V}\\vert_{x+\\Delta x}$ denote a vector $V\\vert_x$ parallel transported to $x+\\Delta x$. We demand that the components satisfy: $$\\tilde{V}^{u}(x+\\Delta x) - V^u(x) \\propto \\Delta x$$ $$\\widetilde{(V^u + W^u)}(x+\\Delta x) = \\tilde{V}(x+\\Delta x) + \\tilde{W}^u(x+\\Delta x)$$\nThese condition are satisfy if we take: $$ \\tilde{V}^u(x+\\Delta x) = V^{u}(x) \\Gamma_{v\\lambda}^u (x) \\Delta x^v $$ The covariant derivative of a vector with respect to $x^v$ is defined by: $$ \\lim_{\\Delta x^v \\to 0} \\frac{V^{u}(x+\\Delta x)-\\tilde{V}^u(x+\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x^v} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^u}$$\n$$=\\lim_{\\Delta x^v \\to 0} \\frac{V^{u}(x+\\Delta x)-V^u(x)-V^{\\lambda}(x)\\Gamma^{u}_{v\\lambda}\\Delta x^v}{\\Delta x^v} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^u} $$\n$$=(\\frac{\\partial V^u}{\\partial x^v} + V^{\\lambda}\\Gamma_{v\\lambda}^u) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^u} $$\n$$= (\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^v}} V)^u $$\nHere, $(\\nabla_{e_v} V)^u$ represents the $u$-th component of the covariant derivative along the $e_v$ direaction at point $x+\\Delta x$ and the $\\nabla$ denotes connection, which will be covered in the subsequent section. The quantity in Eqn $(2)$ is a vector at $x+\\Delta x$ since, it is a difference of two vectors $V\\vert_{x+\\Delta x}$ and $\\tilde{V}\\vert_{x+\\Delta x}$ defined at the same point $x+\\Delta x$. There are many distinct rules of parallel transport possible, one for each choice of $\\Gamma$. If the manifold is endowed with the metric, there exist a predefined choice of $\\Gamma$, called Levi Civita Connection.\nAffine Connection Definition: An affine connection $\\nabla$ is a map: $\\chi (M) \\times \\chi(M) \\to \\chi(M)$, or $(X,Y) \\to \\nabla_{X}Y$ which satisfy the following conditions: $$\\nabla_{X}(Y+Z) = \\nabla_{X}Y + \\nabla_{X}Z$$ $$\\nabla_{X+Y}(Z) = \\nabla_{X}Z + \\nabla_{Y}Z$$ $$\\nabla_{fX}(Y) = f \\nabla_{X}Y $$ $$\\nabla_{X}(fY) = X[f]Y + f\\nabla_{X}Y $$ where, $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, $\\chi(M)$ denotes vector field and $X,Y,Z \\in \\chi(M)$.\nTake a chart $(U,\\phi)$ with the condition $x=\\phi(p)$ on $M$, and define $\\Gamma_{uv}^\\lambda$ called the connection coefficients by:\n$$\\nabla_v e_u = \\nabla_{e_v} e_u = \\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^v}} = e_{\\lambda} \\Gamma_{uv}^\\lambda$$\nwhere, ${e_u} = {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^u}}$ is the cordinate basis in $T_{p}M$. The connection coefficient specify how the basis vectors change from point to point. Let $V=V^ue_u$ and $W = W^ue_v$ be elements of $T_pM$. Then, $\\nabla_V W$ is the connection of the vector $W$, at the direaction of the vector $V$.

They could be con- sidered either gestures, as there is no interaction with a physical object; or as actions, given that there is object manipulation, even if it is virtual. This distinction is important, as literature has shown that in the physical world, action-enabled and gesture-enabled learning produce distinct cognitive outcomes. This study attempts to understand whether sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can cognitively be considered as actions or gestures. It does this by comparing verb-learning outcomes between two conditions: (1) where participants move the controllers without touching virtual objects (gesture condition); and (2) where partici- pants move the controllers and manipulate virtual objects (action condition). We found that (1) users can have cognitively distinct outcomes in IVR based on whether the interactions are actions or gestures, with actions providing stronger memorisation outcomes; and (2) embodied controller actions in IVR behave more similarly to physical world actions in terms of verb memorization benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Actions, not gestures: contextualising embodied controller interactions in immersive virtual reality","type":"example"},{"authors":["**Nick Ballou**","Heiko Breitsohl","Dominic Kao","Kathrin Gerling","Sebastian Deterding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634515200,"objectID":"534111fa1d721b0d5f5d0307b385727c","permalink":"https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","publishdate":"2021-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","section":"example","summary":"Effectance—the basic positive experience of causing effects—provides a promising explanation for the enjoyment derived from novel low-challenge game genres featuring ample ‘juicy’ feedback.

Publication venues play a crucial role in instituting open science practices, especially journals, whose procedures arguably lend themselves better to them than conferences. Yet we know lit- tle about how much HCI journals presently support open science practices. We identified the 51 most frequently published-in jour- nals by recent CHI first authors and coded them according to the Transparency and Openness Promotion guidelines, a high-profile standard of evaluating editorial practices. Results indicate that jour- nals in our sample currently do not set or specify clear openness and transparency standards. Out of a maximum of 29, the modal score was 0 (mean = 2.5, SD = 3.6, max = 15). We discuss potential reasons, the aptness of natural science-based guidelines for HCI, and next steps for the HCI community in furthering openness and transparency.","tags":null,"title":"Are You Open?

While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, and salience. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.","tags":null,"title":"The Hidden Intricacy of Loot Box Design: A Granular Description of Random Monetized Reward Features","type":"example"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game.

In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming: A specification curve analysis of five gaming disorder scales","type":"example"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I’ve been hired as a full time research assistant under Dr. Sejuti Rahman.\n","date":1593388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593388800,"objectID":"241673c76f28688fbd098248131a9792","permalink":"https://swakshardeb.github.io/news/2023-ra_offer.html","publishdate":"2020-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-ra_offer.html","section":"news","summary":"I've been hired as a full time research assistant under Dr. Sejuti Rahmna.","tags":["Job"],"title":"Research Assistantship Under Dr. Sejuti Rahman","type":"news"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"5b78e5980d4842d046513dbcad4068c0","permalink":"https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.322112Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","section":"example","summary":"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee.

By contrast, pay to win microtransactions did not appear to experience similar growth in desktop games during the period, rising gradually to a prevalence of 17.38% by November 2015, at which point growth decelerated significantly (p\u003c0.001) to the point where it was not significantly different from zero (p=0.32).","tags":null,"title":"The Changing Face of Desktop Video Game Monetisation: An Exploration of Trends in Loot Boxes, Pay to Win, and Cosmetic Microtransactions in the Most-Played Steam Games of 2010-2019","type":"example"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","Paul Cairns","Stuart Waters","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"d12588fb761ffbfee6c43bcb624f71a2","permalink":"https://swakshardeb.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.320856Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence.html","section":"example","summary":"**Background and Aims** Loot boxes are items in video games that may be bought for real-world money but provide ran- domized rewards. Formal similarities between loot boxes and gambling have led to concerns that they may provide a ‘gateway’ to gambling amongst children. However, the availability of loot boxes is unclear. This study aimed to determine what proportion of top-grossing video games contained loot boxes, and how many of those games were available to children. **Design, setting and cases** Survey of the 100 top-grossing games on both the Google Play store and the Apple App store, and the top 50 most-played games on Steam according to the data aggregator SteamSpy. Measurements The prevalence of loot boxes was measured for each platform outlined above, split by age rating. **Findings** A total of 58.0% of the top games on the Google Play store contained loot boxes, 59.0% of the top iPhone games contained loot boxes and 36.0% of the top games on the Steam store contained loot boxes; 93.1% of the Android games that featured loot boxes and 94.9% of the iPhone games that featured loot boxes were deemed suitable for children aged 12+. Age ratings were more conservative for desktop games. Only 38.8% of desktop games that featured loot boxes were available to children aged 12+. **Conclusions** Loot boxes appear to be prevalent in video games that are deemed suitable for children, especially on mobile platforms.","tags":null,"title":"The Prevalence of Loot Boxes in Mobile and Desktop Games","type":"example"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Game of life in Rust and Webassembly This is an implementation of Conway\u0026#39;s Game of Life.
